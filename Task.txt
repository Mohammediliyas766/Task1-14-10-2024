Create sample GitHub repo with following ideas,

1. Create Simple Hello World .Net Application with API which returns "Hello World!"

2. Create Github Actions for a repository(Shouldn't allow user to directly commit changes to master)
      Action 1:
      - When user commit changes to feature branch and raise merge request to master branch, it should trigger mail to approver for approval and then once after approval it should merge changes to master.
      Action 2:
      - Once you merge changes to master branch it should trigger another GitHub Workflow for building application, generating release, and upload it to Octopus Deploy

3. CI Workflow: should contains following stages,
      1. Checkout
      2. Setup environment
      3. Build project
      4. Scan it using checkmarx
      5. publish/Upload artifact to Octopus deploy

4. Create simple Octopus Deploy process to use the release and deploy it to Development environment.
      Process Steps:
            Step 1: Raise Approval request
            Step 2: Setup Environment
            Step 2: Deploy Application to local machine
